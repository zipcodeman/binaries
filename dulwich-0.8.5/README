This is the Dulwich project.

It aims to give an interface to git repos (both local and remote) that doesn't
call out to git directly but instead uses pure Python.

The project is named after the part of London that Mr. and Mrs. Git live in 
in the particular Monty Python sketch. It is based on the Python-Git module 
that James Westby <jw+debian@jameswestby.net> released in 2007 and now 
maintained by Jelmer Vernooij et al.
